    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I’ve always been drawn to thinking outside the box—whether it’s coding, collaborating, or both at the same time. My technology journey started early, with a middle school coding class that paved a way for me to find a career I was interested in and a love of problem-solving that’s never burned out. I’m an enthusiastic, optimistic teammate who brings both energy and thoughtfulness to the table.
With a strong academic background and a passion for learning, I take pride in being someone people can count on—reliable, adaptable, and always ready to dive into a new task and solve an issue. </p>

<p>I am a 2025 graduate of University Academy in Kansas City, MO, where I was Vice President of the National Honor Society. I have a passion for technology and aspire to work in cybersecurity, particularly in gaming cybersecurity. My goal is to create a business that employs more people of color in the tech industry, fostering diversity and inclusion.
I intend to crseate a cybersecurity business to employ more people of color interested in technology. I have over a hundred hours of community service and I love to give back to the world. I would love to start a non profit that could pay for their college tuition and help others get into the tech industry. I have also created a cardiac arrest campaign with the American Heart Association to raise awareness and allow others to learn how to help someone who has a cardiac arrest.</p>
